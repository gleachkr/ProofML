# ProofML

ProofML is a collection of custom HTML elements for displaying formal proofs on
the web. The objective is to create some proof-display primitives that 

1. Could serve as an output format for other tools (both interactive apps, and
   HTML generators).

2. Are semantic, in the sense that the actual structure of the represented
   proof is easily recoverable from the HTML.

3. Look pretty good when rendered in a browser.

The basic slogan: It's like MathML, but for proof.
